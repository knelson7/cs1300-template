          The goal of this project is to step into a user’s shoes. I did this by
          observing real users interacting with an interface, a surfboard, and
          then interviewed these individuals about their experiences. Lastly, I
          created personas based on these users, and illustrated a storyboard
          for one of the personas.

          A surfboard enables a user to glide across the ocean surface while
          being propelled by a wave. You stand on the body of the surfboard,
          while the fins help improve directional stability.

            Carrying a surfboard while walking on the beach is difficult if your
            arm is not long enough to reach across the width of the board. This
            is because you can therefore not comfortably tuck the surfboard
            underneath your arm. Instead, one must hold the surfboard parallel
            to the ground and squeeze the surfboard against their oblique.
            Annie, who has shorter arms, had to stop periodically to adjust the
            surfboard and/or rest while walking.
          </li>
          <li class="list-element">
            While paddling out into the ocean, smaller sized users struggled to
            get their surfboard over the oncoming waves. They frequently lost
            control of their surfboard.
          </li>
          <li class="list-element">
            Most users sit on their surfboards quite comfortably while waiting
            for a good waves to catch, once they have paddled out past the area
            where the waves crash.
          </li>

          <li class="list-element">
            Surfboard users that catch many waves, are quick to maneuver their
            surfboards in the water. It is as if the surfboard is an extension
            of their body.
          </li>

          <li class="list-element">
            In contrast, users that don’t catch as many waves and/or fall upon
            attempting to stand up, normally lose track of their board and
            struggle to control it.
          </li>

          <li class="list-element">
            Some users hands and/or feet would slip off of the surfboard while
            standing or pushing with their hands on the board in an attempt to
            stand up.
          </li>

          <li class="list-element">
            Users who successfully stand up normally have smiles on their faces
            while riding the wave in.

       <dl class="list">


        <dt>1. How often do you use a surfboard?	
          </dt>
          <dd class='question-element'>
            The answers varied between the three participants 
            with Rachel having used a surfboard only three times, 
            while Braeden uses one almost everyday.
          </dd>

               
        <dt>2. When did you expect to first successfully stand up on a wave today using the surfboard?
          </dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          Rachel thought it would take her at least 10 tries before a success, 
          while Braeden assumed he’d be able to on the first try. 
          Annie remained in the middle, at around 5 tries. 

        </dd>

             
        <dt>3. What drew you to surfing and wanting to use a surfboard?
          </dt>
          <dd class='question-element'>
            Braeden’s family and friends all surfed competitively when he was younger, 
            which in turn led to him wanting to try it. Rachel and Annie 
            both agreed that using a surfboard looked like a very enjoyable 
            experience and recently decided to take it up as a hobby due to its exciting and athletic nature. 

          </dd>

               
        <dt>4. How were you introduced to surfing and using a surfboard?
          </dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          All three interviewees would see people using 
          surfboards at the beach near their respective residences.
           Braedan’s friend lent him a surfboard many many years ago, and he instantly fell in love with surfing.

        </dd>


             
        <dt>5. How many waves did you catch today?</dt>
          <dd class='question-element'>
            Annie had caught about 15, Braeden caught 32, and Rachel caught 10.
          </dd>

               
        <dt>6. How do you feel or how do you expect to feel when you stand up on the surfboard and ride the wave in to the beach?</dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          All participants described feelings of empowerment, adrenaline, 
          and joy. “Using a surfboard to effectively walk on water is a rush,” states Braedan.
        </dd>

             
        <dt>7. What is the best way to stand on a surfboard to remain upright and balanced?</dt>
          <dd class='question-element'>
            All participants referenced the classic “athletic stance”, which consists of knees 
            slightly bent, with your feet a little more than shoulder width apart, 
            and your arms stretching out from your body for balance. 
          </dd>

               
        <dt>8. Have you taken a surf lesson to learn how to use a surfboard before? </dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          Rachel and Annie had never taken a 
          formal surf lesson before, while Braedan trains regularly with a surf coach.
        </dd>


             
        <dt>9. Have you ever fallen off your surfboard? </dt>
          <dd class='question-element'>
            All participants responded that they have. 
            None of them have sustained any serious injuries, 
            although Braedan says that injuries are not uncommon when using a surfboard. 
          </dd>

               
        <dt>10. How do you feel when you fall off of your surfboard?</dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          Rachel expressed feelings of frustration, while Annie and Braedan agreed that
           it’s part of the experience. Usually falling off of the surfboard is not a big deal since you 
          fall into the water. However, Braedan expressed that falling
           from a standing position onto your surfboard can be dangerous. 
        </dd>

             
        <dt dt>11. What keeps you using your surfboard despite falling?</dt>
          <dd class='question-element'>
            Braedan responded that “it’s all about chasing the swell”, 
            while Rachel and Annie agree that falling is well worth the payoff of successfully riding your surfboard.
          </dd>

               
        <dt>12. What challenges do you face when using your surfboard besides falling? </dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          Annie brought up the fact that her hands slip off of the surface of the board when 
          they go to stand up, while Rachel said that the board is quite hard and she’s afraid of the board hitting her accidentally.
          Lastly Braedan mentioned that for the most part, he doens't run into problems since he's so well practiced. 
        </dd>

             
        <dt>13. What is the function of the fins on the surfboard?</dt>
          <dd class='question-element'>
            Everyone replied that the fins make the surfboard more stable so that 
            you can stand on it and the fins also increases maneuverability allowing you to turn while standing on your surfboard.
          </dd>

               
        <dt>14. Where do you usually stand on the surfboard when riding it?</dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          All participants reported that they stand near the middle of the surfboard,
           but shift their weight forwards or backwards in response to how the surfboard is gliding on the water.
        </dd>

               
        <dt>15. How do you carry your surfboard while walking on the beach?</dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          Braedan and Rachel hold the surfboard underneath their arm, while Annie has to hold the board against her hip. 
        </dd>
               
        <dt>16. What would you change about the surfboard, if anything, to make it work better for you?</dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          Braedan responded that he would want the surface to be less slick, 
          to prevent slipping. Annie would want a handle on the board so that it’s easier to transport. 
        </dd>

               
        <dt>17. Do you find that the surfboard is easily maneuverable when it’s in the water? </dt>
        <dd class='question-element'>
          Participants responded that the board is easy to maneuver for the most part in the water, but sometimes a 
          wave can separate the user from the surfboard, in which case then the wave takes control of the surfboard. Braedan 
          said that it just takes practice.

          Elite Erica is a veteran surfboard user. She has been using a surfboard for more than 10 years and
          glides across the water atop his surfboard with ease. 
          She's committed to being the best surfboard user she can be and works hard to get better. 
          Despite Erica's wealth of experience, she still falls off of her surfboard at times, due to the slick, wet surface.
          Erica represents surfboard users who have either been trained or have been surfing for a very long time and can successfully
          stand on their surfboard, turn, and do other tricks. 
          These users experience less challenges with using a surfboard, but still struggle at times, due to the 
          variability of ocean and wave conditions.

        <p class=para>
          Some of the users that I observed had problems with their hands and feet slipping off of the surfboards pretty frequently. 
          I did some further research on this and found that normally surfboard users put wax on the body of their board where their feet 
          go. The users that I observed rented boards from a surfboard rental shop. Therefore, they couldn't put wax on their surfboards.
